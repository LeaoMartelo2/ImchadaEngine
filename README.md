# ImchadaEngine

A C++ Linux terminal game engine, based of a old [project of mine](https://github.com/LeaoMartelo2/makefile_git), inspired by ural89's [ConsoleCraftEngine](https://github.com/ural89/ConsoleCraftEngine)

## Using the Engine


This is a simple guide on how to use the engine in your project.

- Copy/Symlink the engine/Imchada folder to your project source.
- include the wanted/required features of the engine on your file
	 <sup>(ex: `#include "../Imchada/sample.h"` or whatever fits your project) <sup/>
