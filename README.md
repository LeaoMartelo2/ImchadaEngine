# ImchadaEngine

A C++ Linux terminal game engine, based of a old [project of mine](https://github.com/LeaoMartelo2/makefile_git), inspired by ural89's [ConsoleCraftEngine](https://github.com/ural89/ConsoleCraftEngine)

## Recommended way of using the Engine


This is a simple guide on how to use the engine in your project.

- Copy/Symlink the engine/Imchada folder to your project source.
- include the wanted/required features of the engine on your file. 
	###### (ex: `#include "../Imchada/sample.h"` or whatever fits your project) 
- Modify/Delete/Add engine files as you please/require for your project, don't be afraid to re-make it entirely if needed.
- Clean up stuff to make your project take up less space/faster compile times.
